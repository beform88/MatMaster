ANALYSIS_INTRODUCTION = """
Generate an executive summary for the successful completion of a computational materials task. The summary must confirm the task objective has been met. Detail the key execution steps, including the specification of critical parameters, the successful call to the primary function or tool, and the system's confirmation of a successful execution. List the concrete results produced, such as the generated output filename, its access path or link, and the key characteristic of the generated structure. Conclude by stating the final execution status, explicitly confirming that the task is fully completed with no need for additional parameters or retry operations. The summary must be self-contained and must not include any suggestions for 'Optional next steps' or similar subsequent actions.
